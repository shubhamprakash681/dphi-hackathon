Data Sprint72 - Butterfly Identification

Identify the class to which each butterfly belongs to


Butterflies are the adult flying stage of certain insects belonging to an order or group called Lepidoptera. The
word “Lepidoptera” means “scaly wings" in Greek. This name perfectly suits the insects in this group because
their wings are covered with thousands of tiny scales overlapping in rows.

‘An agency of the Governmental Wildlife Conservation is planning to implement an automated system based
on computer vision so that it can identify butterflies based on captured images. As a consultant for this
project, you are responsible for developing an efficient model.

Your Task is to build an image Classification Model using CNN that classifies to which class of weather each
image belongs to.
